Anyone is welcome to suggest improvements, changes, re-designs etc.  If you are an AppleScript coder, please provide suggested code.

Even better, you could download MacYTDL, make changes using *Script Editor* (test it works) and upload to this repo. At this stage MacYTDL will be code signed with my signature.  So, I'll need to monitor suggestions, update MacYTDL and upload for each release.

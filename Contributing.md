Anyone is welcome to suggest improvements, changes, re-designs etc.  If you are an AppleScript coder, please provide suggested code.  It's best to create a new issue or pull request.

Even better, you could download MacYTDL, make changes using *Script Editor* (test it works) and upload to this repo. At this stage MacYTDL will be code signed with my signature.  So, I'll need to monitor contributions, incorporate the new code, test, update the Help and Versions files and upload for each release.
